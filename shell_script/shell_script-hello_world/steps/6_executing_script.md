Now that you already know how to create and give executions permission to a script, let's try to execute it and check what are the results!

## Executing script

To execute a script you just have to call the command "bash" and pass your script as a parameter. 

For example, try to type the following command into the terminal:

```sh
bash /root/shell/my_first_shell.sh
```

`bash /root/shell/my_first_shell.sh`{{execute}}

## Result checking

Saw the result in the terminal? You'll probably see something like this:
